This fort's expanse is vast and it was under serious consideration for capital of Swarajya by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. However later that crown went to Raigad due to impending threat from Siddhi of Murud-Janjeera.

One of the best treks. There is roadworks going on currently in end of Jan'25 due to which you have to walk almost 5-6kms additional. Very helpful people. I also recommend eating your breakfast and lunch/dinner at Sudhagad Bhatkanti. Please do not eat food at top as there are monkeys at the top. Kindly do not go for trekking in summers, it can cause heatstroke. Carry enough water as you can get it only in the base village. One of the best treks in Maharashtra.
